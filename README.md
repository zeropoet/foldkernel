# FoldKernel

## Place in the studio architecture

This repository is an independently governed module and project authority. [`zeropoet.xyz`](https://zeropoet.xyz/) is the studio index: it makes this work and its relations legible without absorbing them. [`rootlogos.com`](https://rootlogos.com/) is the public surface of synthesis: it builds from bounded outputs of the studio's repositories without replacing their sources, histories, or laws. This separation fulfills the system's working law—preserve authority at the source, reveal relation at studio scale, and permit synthesis without possession—as Root Logos enters its Weave era.

FoldKernel is a deterministic protocol engine for generating verifiable coherence artifacts.

Canonical public entry: [foldkernel.zeropoet.xyz](https://foldkernel.zeropoet.xyz/).
FoldKernel is a studio substrate beneath the Mancel Lindsey / Zeropoet artist
and developer identity. Future works and instruments may begin from it at their
own `<work>.zeropoet.xyz` address without inheriting another system's authority.

## Telos relation

Telos is the connected system's final caretaker and keeper. It may witness
FoldKernel's public identity and relations, but it cannot alter the protocol or
replace its deterministic authority. Those bounded relations can shape Telos's
evolving **Living System**. Telos is growing toward a machine-native visual,
sonic, and open-orientation language capable of noticing drift and preserving
relation, without claiming consciousness, revelation, personhood, or final
authority.

It defines the mathematical and cryptographic rules used by the Fold coherence instrument to transform structured interaction into reproducible symbolic artifacts.

The kernel contains no user interface, rendering system, or application logic.
It exists purely as protocol infrastructure.

FoldKernel guarantees that identical interaction histories always produce identical artifacts.
This determinism allows Fold artifacts to be independently reproduced, verified, and interpreted across different implementations.

The protocol implements the following deterministic pipeline:

interaction
→ permutation events
→ memory signature
→ convergence hash

From this pipeline, higher-level systems can derive symbolic representations such as sigils or registry artifacts without altering the underlying protocol.

FoldKernel is intentionally minimal and stable.
Exploration layers, visualizations, and interaction vessels are built on top of the kernel rather than inside it.

The Swift package is the reference implementation, not the sole definition of
the protocol. The normative byte-level contract is documented in
[`PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md), and machine-readable compatibility fixtures live
in [`Tests/FoldKernelTests/Resources/conformance-vectors.json`](Tests/FoldKernelTests/Resources/conformance-vectors.json).
Any future implementation must reproduce those vectors byte-for-byte before it
can claim FoldKernel compatibility.

## Build with FoldKernel

Start with the [developer preview](DEVELOPER.md). A runnable example accepts a
permutation, lock-state byte, and topology byte, then emits the exact memory
signature, convergence hash, and structural state:

```bash
swift run fold-kernel-example
```

The [product boundary](PRODUCT.md) distinguishes the open protocol that exists
today from managed runtime, certification, instrument, and Telos services that
remain future-facing. No paid service is implied by this repository release.

## Integration contract

Applications can publish a stable, public declaration of their FoldKernel
version, event meanings, conformance-vector digest, and authority boundary.
The Swift verifier runs all fifteen canonical checks before it emits a
commit-specific receipt:

```bash
swift run fold-kernel-integration conformance
swift run fold-kernel-integration verify foldkernel-integration.json \
  --source-commit "$GIT_COMMIT" \
  --verified-at "2026-08-31T12:00:00Z" \
  --output foldkernel-integration-receipt.json
```

The declaration schema is
[`Integration/foldkernel-integration.schema.json`](Integration/foldkernel-integration.schema.json).
The application owns event meaning and history, FoldKernel owns canonical
encoding and convergence identity, and Telos may only observe public versions,
verify the declared public contract, and report drift.

## Value receipts

[`FoldKernel-Value-Receipt-1.0.0`](VALUE_RECEIPTS.md) is an additive contract
for carrying evidence of useful work through `unrealized`, `evidenced`,
`realized`, and `settled` states. It does not alter any FoldKernel-1.0.0 hash or
artifact output. Internal work cannot carry money until a receipt cites an
external valuation basis and evidence digest; settlement cannot change the
realized amount. Version 1.0 receipts are non-transferable, non-purchasable,
non-appreciating, and contain no personal data.

## Transformation receipts

[`FoldKernel-Transformation-Receipt-1.0.0`](TRANSFORMATION_RECEIPTS.md) records
that a preserved source was transformed, fulfilled, consumed, superseded, or
retired. A derived output is required where one is claimed, but the source is
never deleted or replaced. The receipt is deterministic, non-destructive,
non-transferable, non-purchasable, non-appreciating, non-monetary, and contains
no personal data. Operational systems may interpret a verified receipt through
their own bounded capacity policy; they may not treat it as a coin or price.

## Components

FoldKernel provides:

• permutation validation
• canonical square definition
• D4 symmetry orbit
• adjacency graph derivation
• arithmetic invariant evaluation
• canonical distance metric
• structural convergence detection
• stateless memory encoding
• keccak-256 hash derivation

---

## Deterministic Guarantees

For any identical sequence of events:

• the memory signature will be identical  
• the convergence hash will be identical  
• artifacts are reproducible across machines  

FoldKernel contains no randomness, timestamps, or external runtime
dependencies. Its CI pins a Swift 6.1.2 toolchain to run the modern Swift
Testing conformance suite while the package manifest remains compatible with
Swift Package Manager 5.9 consumers.

---

## Version

Current protocol version:

FoldKernel-1.0.0

Current Swift package release: `v1.0.5`.

The protocol version is embedded directly into artifact hashes.

Future revisions will increment this identifier.

Package releases may receive patch-level infrastructure updates without
changing the embedded protocol identifier. Such releases must not alter any
canonical output.

---

## Architecture

FoldKernel is designed to be used by higher-level systems:

FoldKernel → protocol  
Instrument → interaction vessel  
SigilEngine → artifact interpretation

This repository contains only the protocol layer.

---

## Identity

The FoldKernel mark is a load-bearing plan: an outer protocol boundary folds
inward around a protected canonical kernel. Its four equal paths express the
symmetry, deterministic transformation, and structural convergence implemented
by the protocol.

The canonical mark and production variants are maintained in
[`Assets/Brand`](Assets/Brand/README.md).
